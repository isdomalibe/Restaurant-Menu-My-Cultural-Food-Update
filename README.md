# Nigerian Restaurant Menu 🍽️  

This was my First Programming. It is a simple, yet creative restaurant menu built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It displays a selection of **Nigerian food** dishes with their respective prices, bringing a personal touch to the project. This was my first project on GitHub and a great introduction to web development.
